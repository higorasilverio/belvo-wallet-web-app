# Belvo Wallet Web App

### Intro

In a fictional world, we are branching into the crypto payments market and we are building a
payment wallet. To achieve this we have built a JSON API that will serve as backend and
exposes the endpoints needed by the application.
The wallet API is served at [belvo-wallet-challenge-api](https://belvo-wallet-challenge-api.herokuapp.com), with its documentation available at /docs and /redoc.

### Instructions

To run this project it is not necessary any complicated configuration, just clone the repository
and type `yarn start` in your terminal.
To access the application it is necessary to login through the authentication page:

> **username**: _vicky_

> **password**: _secret_

There are two other pages that could be accessed by the upper navbar: **Wallet** and **Transfer**.
At the **Wallet** page, it is possible to verify the wallet summary, with the current balance and the last
five transactions made.
At **Transfer**, it is possible to perform a transference from your account to one of your previous
registered contacts, regarding your current balance.
